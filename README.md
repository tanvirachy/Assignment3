# Assignment3

So far I have done parts 1 and 2. 
a)I have collected 444 observations to get started(there's more that is being streamed and I will add them to the existing dataset)
b)Saved data locally
c) Processed and prepared data for natural language processing
d) Did some predictive modelling with logistic regression, decision tree classifier, 
random forest classifier, naive bayes classifier, linear support vector classifier and one-versus 
rest classifier.
e) Used evaluation criteria such as AUC, precision,recall,f1-score, test error as well as 
accuracy
f)Used the models using count vectorization and word2vec. Started using tf-idf and crossvalidation. 
In the upcoming 2 weeks, I will:
a) Increase the size of the dataset by collecting more data-
so I will update the results frequently
b)Try to extend tf-idf and cross-validation
c)Fix and improve the existing code 
d)Do part 3) of assignment 3
e)Write up assignment findings and procedure on overleaf
